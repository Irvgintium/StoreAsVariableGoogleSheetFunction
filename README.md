# StoreAsVariableGoogleSheetFunction
This is a simple Google Apps Script project where I use the functionality of the [Properties Service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/properties) to create a custom function that will allows users to store any specific sheet functions as variables &amp; be used several times in a complex very complex Google Sheet function by only calling the configured "Variable Name" instead of the actual Google Sheet function (for readability purposes).
